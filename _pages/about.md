My research centers on multimodal AI with a particular emphasis on video-centric modeling. My goal is to empower AI systems to assist humans in interpreting complex video content, facilitating high-level reasoning across applications such as sports analytics, surveillance, and media content analysis. I am deeply interested in exploring three key areas for a comprehensive understanding of videos:

1. **Efficient Video Representation**: Addressing the high computational demands of video data by developing efficient learning approaches..
   
2. **Perception and Reasoning in Videos**: Tackling the challenge of understanding temporal dynamics, including frame continuity, causality, and long-term dependencies.

3. **Multi-modal Learning**: Leveraging audio encoded in video streams to extract semantic information that complements, yet remains distinct from, visual semantics.
