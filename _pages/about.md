I am currently pursuing my master's degree under the supervision of professor [Yukyung Choi](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=vMrPtrAAAAAJ&hl=en) at the [Robotics and Computer Vision Lab](https://www.rcv.sejong.ac.kr/home). My research focuses on Computer Vision, specifically Video Understanding. I am deeply interested in exploring the following three key areas for a comprehensive understanding of videos:

1. **Human Action Understanding**: I view distinguishing dynamic human behaviors as a foundational task that necessitates temporal modeling.
   
2. **Scene Graph Representation**: I believe it offers essential frameworks for organizing and interpreting the intricate visual data present in videos.

3. **Open-Vocabulary Learning**: I consider it crucial for enabling robust inference in various unseen scenarios, which is vital for practical applications.
