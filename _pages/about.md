I am currently pursuing my master's degree under the guidance of Professor [Yukyung Choi](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=vMrPtrAAAAAJ&hl=en) at the [Robotics and Computer Vision Lab](https://www.rcv.sejong.ac.kr/home). My research interests are centered around Computer Vision, with a particular focus on Video Understanding. For a deeper understanding of videos, I focus on the following three topics:

1. Human Action Understanding: I consider distinguishing dynamic human behaviors as the most fundamental task that demands temporal modeling.

2. Scene Graph Representation: I believe it provides crucial representations for structuring and interpreting the complex visual information in videos.

3. Open-Vocabulary Learning: I think it is essential for enabling robust inference on diverse scenarios unseen during training, crucial for practical applications.
